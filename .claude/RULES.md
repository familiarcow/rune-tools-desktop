  My Committed CSS Development Protocol:

  1. Always use component-scoped selectors (.wallet-portfolio-*, .component-name-*)
  2. Test each change individually before proceeding
  3. Start with inline styles for testing, then move to scoped CSS
  4. Never modify global selectors (.btn, .card, etc.)
  5. Incremental changes only - one small change at a time
